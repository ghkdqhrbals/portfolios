# What is difference between OSI 7 Layers and TCP/IP 4 Layers?

There are 7 layers of OSI and 4 layers of TCP/IP which suppport every protocol of computer. The difference is that how they divide the layers. OSI 7 layers and TCP/IP 4 layers have some overlap and some don't. See below.

# Physical Layer
* PDU = **Bit** unit
> PDU=Protocol Data Unit. Every layer has its PDU. For Physical Layer, "**Bit**"
* Mesh, Start (Hub) and Ring are representative of this layer.
> This layer does not concern whether the bits wrong or have error. Only transmit or recept!

# DataLink Layer
* PDU = **Frame** unit
* L2-Switch is representative of this layer
```
DataLink Layer
(sublayers)
|____ LCC(Logical Link Control)
|     |___ Flow control
|     |___ Multiplexing
|
|____ MAC(Medium Access Control)
        |___ CSMA/CD
        |___ CSMA/CA
        |___ Retransmission
        |___ Framing
        |___ FCS frame check sequence
```
{: file="DataLink Layer"}
* LCC : Provide Flow control & Multiplexing for logical link
  * Flow-control : Prevents excessive reception by others
  * Multiplexing : Mapping into a original packet from separated packets
* MAC : Dealing with collisions, framing, checking sequences.
  * CSMA/CD,CA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detetion, Avoidance): If two users are both listen or transmit their packet in a same time, there should be collapsed!. With Media Access Control, frame recovery & avoid & retransmit are occured here.
  * Framing : = capsulation. I bring the representative example of Framing(Ethernet) here.

  * MAC address consist of **12** hexadecimal characters. And MAC address is also called as NIC(Network Interface Card) number.

# Network Layer
* PDU = **Packet** unit
* Router is representative of this layer

```
Network Layer
(protocol)
|____ ARP
|____ IP
|____ ICMP
```
## ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)
* ARP : To communicate inside **local network**, MAC address is essential. ARP help to find right MAC address.   
> Here is a cached arp address in local network
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/arp.png)
* ARP steps for find right MAC address. First `Apple_e0:7f:fe` is Desination address and that's me. As `fe:8f:20:52:f2:03` **already know my IP and MAC address**, he wants to know my IP and MAC address is correct. 
> ARP Request
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/arp_request.png)
* Response just switching Dst and Src.
> ARP Response
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/arp_reply.png)

* However, if he dont know about MAC address or IP address? Here is examples.
> ARP Request broadcasting(know Target IP)
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/arp_broadcasting.png)
* Here, you can see Target IP is declared but still, MAC address is empty. This packet is broadcasted and if `192.168.219.108` get this packet, `192.168.219.108` send back to `192.168.219.1` filled with its MAC address in Src MAC address. Thus, when you want to know target's IP or MAC address, **you should know at least one either IP or MAC address**.

## IP

* IP : In local network, we can communicate each others with MAC address. However, if you want to communicate outside of local network(Router), IP address is essential.
> Here is example of how IP looks like.
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/IP.png)
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/IP_structure.png)

* TTL(Time To Live) is a hop limit for alive, and it is a good way for self destructing. **However, TTL has limitations as below**
> The IPv4 RFC states that TTL is measured in seconds but acknowledges this is an imperfect measure. **There is no way of knowing how long any particular host will take to process a packet and most will do so in far less than a second.** In any case, based on this logic, in theory the maximum time a packet can exist in the network is 4.25 minutes (255 seconds). Hence, the TTL is described as a "self destruct time limit".

* TTL is different by its OS. As my OS is MACOS, my hop limit will be 64.
  
| OS                            | hop limits | protocol          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Linux kernel 2.4 (circa 2001) | 255        | TCP, UDP and ICMP |
| Linux kernel 4.10 (2015)      | 64         | TCP, UDP and ICMP |
| Windows XP (2001)             | 128        | TCP, UDP and ICMP |
| Windows 10 (2015)             | 128        | TCP, UDP and ICMP |
| Windows Server 2008           | 128        | TCP, UDP and ICMP |
| Windows Server 2019 (2018)    | 128        | TCP, UDP and ICMP |
| MacOS (2001)                  | 64         | TCP, UDP and ICMP |

## ICMP

* ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) : This protocol manage whether specific IP address is reachable using various flags(e.g. Destination Unreachable, Ping, etc.)

# Transport Layer
* PDU = **Segment** unit
* L4-switch is representative of this layer
* This layer allows users communicate with reliable data. So here also exist error detection and recovery.

## The difference between TCP and UDP

|    Protocol Type    |                       TCP                       |                           UDP                           |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |
|   Connection Type   |          connection-oriented protocol           |                connection-less protocol                 |
|     Optimal use     | **HTTPS(<=HTTP 2.x)**, **HTTP**, SMTP, POP, FTP | **HTTPS(HTTP 3.0)**, Video conferencing, streaming, DNS |
|   Error checking    |      checksum, ack(duplication, sequence)       |                        checksum                         |
|   Data sequencing   |                      able                       |                         unable                          |
|   Retransmission    |                      able                       |                         unable                          |
| Guaranteed delivery |                      able                       |                         Unable                          |
|        Speed        |                       low                       |                          high                           |

* **TCP** use 3-way handshake to verify the endpoint of users. 4-way handshake for cutting off connection. That means TCP stands for connection-oriented.  
> TCP structure
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/tcp.png)
> RTT is round trip time. SEQ/ACK analysis shows that this segment belongs to `frame 88`, so can **concatenate all segment into one packet** for upper layer.

* **UDP** doesn't use any handshake. Sender dont know that receiver get the right packet or not.
> UDP structure
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/1/udp.png)

> Nowadays packet loss rate is lower and lower, so we dont have to use TCP protocol. So recently **HTTP 3.0** is made on UDP(not based on TCP) to speed up RTT.

# Session Layer
* Session layer supports establishment, management, and termination of connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes check-pointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures.
> if we set connection using TCP 3-way handshake, ACK and SEQ numbers, timestamps, etc. are stored in here.

# Presentation Layer
* This layer supports encoding and decoding packets by its format(e.g. base64-encoding, image-format, html, etc.).

# Application Layer
This layer has so many things to talk. So I will talk in next posts.
