# TLS 1.2

* TLS encrpyt all your application data in packet. Here is a whole process of how server/client exhange their keys and how they encrypt packets.

Before TLS, Server create **CSR**
> CSR contains Country Name, State or Province Name, Locality Name, Organization, Organization Unit, Common Name
{: .prompt-info}
> ![a](../../../../assets/p/3/CA.png)

And next, Server send CSR to CA(Certificate Authority)

> 1. A -> Certificate Authority(Google, Amazon, etc.)
  CSR(Certificate Signing Request) : A's pub_key + identity + sign(A's priv_key,(A's pub_key, identity))
> 2. Certificate Authority -> A
  check A's sign and sign with Certificate Authority's priv_key
> 3. A's Certificate : CSR + sign(Certificate Authority's priv_key, content1)
> 4. A -> B
  with A's Certificate
> 5. B
  verify A's Certificate with Certificate Authority's pub_key

  Here, Man in the Middle can not replace A's pub_key with their pub_key.   
  Now Server has `certificate`! And from now, they can open port HTTPS(443).   
  **To exchange server/client encryption key**, TLS do **handshakes**. It is little bit different  by its version. First TLS 1.2 version do their handshake as below.   

## Initial Handshake(2-RTT)
1. Client Hello
  *	Client send `Client Hello` to Server
  *	`Client Hello` : [Version, Nonce, Session ID, Cipher Suites, Compression Methods, etc.]

2. Server Hello
  *	Server send `Server Hello` to Client
  *	`Server Hello` : [Version, Nonce, Session ID, Cipher Suites, Compression Methods, etc.]

3. Certificate
  *	Server also send `certificate` to Client
  *	If Server need Client's certificate, they reqeust.
  *	Client verify Server's certificate with CA's pubkey and etc.

4. Server Key Exchange
  * Server make ECDHE key pairs and send public key to Client with message type `Server Key Exchange`
  * This key will be used to make ECDHE shared secret(symetric key).

5. Certificate Request(optional)
  * Server send `Certificate Request` to Client(if Server wants it)

6. Server Hello Done
  * Server inform Client that my handshake process is done!

7. Certificate(optional)
  *	Client send `certificate` to Server
  *	Server verify Client's certificate
  
8. Client Key Exchange
  * Cient make ECDHE key pairs and send public key to Server with message type `Client Key Exchange`
  > Encryption Keys Calculation   
  > * Server caculate **PreMasterSecret**(ECDHE shared secret) using Client's public key.   
  > * Client caculate **PreMasterSecret**(ECDHE shared secret) using Server's public key.   
  > * Server/Client caculate **MasterSecret** with **PreMasterSecret**, **Nonce** using **HMAC**.   
  > * MasterSecret has   
  >     * Server/Client's MAC key
  >     * Server/Client's symetric key
  >     * Server/Client IV(Initial Vector) for CBC.   

9. Certificate Verify
  *	Client hash all handshake messages and sign, send to Server.
  *	Server verify sign and compare hash that is same as mine.

10. Change Cipher Spec
  * Client inform Server that from now, i will send all messages with encrpyted data.
  
11.  Finished(Encrypted Handshake Message)
  * Client hash all handshake messages and **encrypt** with shared-key, send to Server.

12. Change Cipher Spec
  * Server inform Client that from now, i will send all messages with encrpyted data.

13. Finished(Encrypted Handshake Message)
    * Server hash all handshake messages and **encrypt** with shared-key, send to Client.



# TLS 1.3
![a](../../../../assets/p/3/tls13.png)
1.	Add 0-RTT, 1-RTT for handshake.
2.	Remove key exchange methods that dont support forward secrecy.

## Initial Handshake(1-RTT)
1. Client Hello
  *	Same with TLS 1.2, but Client make ECDHE key pairs and send public key to Server with message type `Client Hello`  

2. Server Hello
  *	ServerHello + Server Key Exchange + Certificate Request + Certificate + Finished = encrypt(TLS1.3 `Server Hello`)"

3. Finished(Certificate + CertificateVerify + Finished=encrypt(TLS1.3 ClientHello)+ “Application Data” )
  * Certificate + CertificateVerify + Finished = encrypt(TLS1.3 ClientHello)
  * Here, Client can send add Application data(which is supported from TLS 1.3 **1-RTT**)

# TCP+HTTPS+DNS RTT Comparison(TLS 1.2 vs TLS 1.3)
To summary, Here is table for comparing RTT with TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.


| is initial or resumption? | TLS 1.2                | TLS 1.3                  | TLS 1.3 + 0-RTT |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| New connection            | 3 RTT(TCP:1,TLS:2)     | 2 RTT(TCP:1,TLS:1) + DNS | 3 RTT + DNS     |
| Resume connection         | 3 RTT(TCP:1,TLS:2)+DNS | 2 RTT(TCP:1,TLS:1) + DNS | 2 RTT + DNS     |
