# CPU scheduling algorithm
* CPU schedule CPU resouces to each threads with following algorithm from Ready Queue
* non-preemptive : doesn't stop Job
  * FCFS : execute First in
  * SJF : execute shortest running time job
* preemptive : does stop Job when assigned time is running out
  * Round Robin : when time(you can set) exceed, insert job to queue again in the back
  * SRF : when shortest job insert in Ready Queue, stop current job and run it


# To summarize
OS's has 4 jobs    
* CPU scheduling and process management
* Memory management
* Disk file management
* I/O device management
