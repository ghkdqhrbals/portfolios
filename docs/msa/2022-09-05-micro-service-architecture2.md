# What is MSA?
![monoly_msa](../../../assets/p/6/Monolithic_MSA.PNG)
* Monolithic's **Disadvantage**
  * Changes in some modules affect the entire application
  * Lack of scalability

* Micro Service Architecture's **Advantage**
  * Scalability
    * To update just one service, we don't need to shut down the whole services
    * Which means, we can focus on specific services which are important
  * Fast Developement
    * We can deploy each service seperately without dependency(which monolithic architecture cannot)
    > You don't have to wait until other team finish their developement
  * Reusability
    * We can re-use service easily which is directly related to **scalability**
  * De-coupling
    * As the coupling between services is reduced, team building becomes easier and more free
    * This improves the ability to embrace new technologies
    * Reduced maintenance difficulty.
    > In the case of monolith, if an error occurs. We have to go through the whole project in debug. However in MSA, project is small thus can be easily debugged

* Micro Service Architecture's **Disadvantage**
  * Increased maintenance difficulty
    * As I said above, **Unit tests** are completed quickly, but **integration tests** that go back and forth to other parts **take a lot more time** than monolithic ones
  * Hard to control transactions
    * In the case of an integrated service that use multiple services, it is difficult to handle transactions
    * To overcome with this disadvantage, we can use **Saga** pattern

> To summarize MSA, if your service needs a lot of traffic, move a lot of money, need continous intergration, it will be best choise. ex) Portal site, shopping site etc.
> Beacuse MSA can gives you scalability, fast dev.,  Reduce server restart time by isolating failed services etc.
