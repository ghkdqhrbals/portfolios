## Introduction

Previously, the user notification logic was embedded directly in our business logic, with a failover sequence like `PUSH → SMS → Alimtalk`. Each stage was blocking and sequential, which meant the entire notification process could take up to 15 seconds to complete.

> In other words, the user might have to wait 15 seconds after placing an order.

To address this, our team decided to offload time-consuming tasks to a separate server and handle notification dispatching through a distributed and failover-capable MQ system.

We initially searched for **Amazon MQ**. It offered easy integration with AWS Client VPN and IAM, but the pricing? A single broker was projected to cost about **1,000,000won/month**.

**Too expensive.** So we pivoted: "Let’s build an MQ ourselves using Redis Stream, which we were already using in production."

Here’s what we needed to address:

1. Event Rebalancing
2. Fair Event Distribution
3. DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)
4. Consumer Lifecycle Management

Let’s go over each one.

## Event Rebalancing

When a consumer reads an event using `XREADGROUP`, Redis Stream stores it in the **Pending Entry List (PEL)**, which means the message was delivered but not yet acknowledged (ACK).

If the consumer dies or fails to process the message, it stays in the PEL. After a certain `idle_time`, other healthy consumers must take over using `XAUTOCLAIM` or `XCLAIM`. This is known as **event rebalancing**.

To implement this, consumers periodically scan the PEL and reprocess failed messages that have been idle too long.

## Fair Event Distribution

Each of our consumers polls Redis every second using `XREADGROUP`. The problem? If three consumers (C1, C2, C3) are running and their polling intervals are slightly offset, say:

* C1 at 1.0s
* C2 at 1.1s
* C3 at 1.2s

Then C1 ends up consuming most of the traffic. We visualized this to make the imbalance clear:

![a](../2025-05-02-16-13-47.png)

To resolve this, we explored two strategies:

1. Use a randomized polling interval per consumer (e.g., 1–1.3s)

   * Easy to implement
   * Doesn’t guarantee perfect balance

2. Use deterministic sharding:

   ```kotlin
   aliveConsumerIds.minByOrNull { hash(eventId + it) } == myConsumerId
   ```

   * First, fetch events via `XRANGE`
   * Calculate the hash for each event + consumer ID
   * If I’m the assigned consumer, proceed with `XREADGROUP`
   * Prevents duplicates when combined with locking

The general process looks like this:

* **Reprocessing**: `XPENDING → filter by hash → XREADGROUP → XACK`
* **New consumption**: `XINFO GROUPS → XRANGE → filter by hash → XREADGROUP → XACK`

### Preventing Duplicates

Let’s say C1 is about to process `event-a` because the hash-based filter selected it. Just before it locks and processes the event, a new consumer C2 joins. It also gets added to `aliveConsumerIds`, and now when calculating the hash, it too becomes eligible for `event-a`.

To avoid such duplication, **C1 must acquire a lock before consuming**, ensuring only one consumer processes an event.

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Redis PEL tracks the number of times an event was delivered. If it exceeds a certain retry threshold, we move it to a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.

You can either ACK the event and log it, or store it elsewhere for manual intervention. This ensures the system doesn’t loop forever on broken events.

## Consumer Lifecycle Management

Unlike Kafka, Redis doesn’t offer built-in consumer lifecycle tracking.

We needed a **synchronized list of alive consumers** to use in our hash-based routing logic.

### Option 1: `XINFO CONSUMERS`

You can use `XINFO CONSUMERS` to check consumer activity, but this has caveats. If no messages exist, all consumers appear idle, and you may mistakenly remove healthy consumers.

### Option 2: Custom Heartbeats

So we implemented a custom mechanism:

* Each consumer registers its ID as a key with a TTL (e.g., `SET {streamKey}:alive:nodes:{consumerId}`)
* It also adds its ID to a Redis Set (e.g., `SADD {streamKey}:alive:nodes:set`)
* We periodically scan the set and check if the corresponding key still exists

  * If not, we remove the ID from the set
  * If yes, the consumer is alive

Note: Redis Sets don’t support TTLs per value, so TTLs were tracked separately via keys.

Also, wildcard search like `{streamKey}:alive:nodes:*` isn’t indexed — full scan would be required. That’s why we kept the Set.

We also built a sync job to periodically clean up stale consumers from both Redis and the Stream Group.

## Conclusion

Kafka and Amazon MQ are powerful — but heavy and expensive. Redis, which we already used, turned out to be a solid lightweight alternative.

This project was especially fun because I enjoy raw, low-level architecture. I had full control over the design, automation, and reliability mechanisms — everything from hash-based load distribution to consumer heartbeat tracking.

Sure, Redis lacks disk persistence, partitioning, or out-of-the-box rebalancing. But for lightweight events like user notifications, Redis Stream was a fast and reliable fit.

Most importantly, I got to deeply understand how a messaging system **should** work — and that made all the effort worth it.
